# Myocardial-perfusion-and-segmentation-API

API prototype for myocardial magnetic resonance image visualization and segmentation and perfusion curve analysis this prototype has been developed in the Python( 3.6) programming language using tkinter, opencv, scikit, tensorflow (Ver 1.14) and other libraries with the distributor Anaconda. 

# 1. Demo 

In the **"Dataset"** folder you can find images in DICOM format that were used to test the application.


# 2. Installation

## Environment installation

Next, we will explain how to install the environment used to use the program, from installing anaconda to implementing the virtual environment with the **environment.yml** file:

1.	Install the anaconda distributor.

2.	Once installed, you must enter the Anaconda navigator.

3.	go to **"Environments"**, then to **"root"**, press the arrow and press open terminal to create a virtual environment with the following command in the terminal:

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
```
With this, the virtual environment is ready to run the application

## Trained model

The trained model is the algorithm that processes the heart images and delivers the results. To integrate the trained model to the application, you must:

1.	Download model from the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yKvDG5ozL1sTA0WbBU00TrHb3jZKOLGL/view?usp=sharing
2.	Place the model in the **"segmentation"** folder of the project.

With that the application should work and process the images correctly.

# 3. Notes

1. To execute the application run **"test.py"**, you can run it via terminal commands or some IDE like PyCharm, just remember to use the delivered virtual environment (**environment.yml**)
2. The **"Export results"** button is currently unavailable.
